## 2023-11-23 - Avoiding clones in Rust iterators
**Learning:** In Rust, iterating over references `for item in &collection` requires cloning the fields if they are needed by value. Consuming the collection by taking ownership `for item in collection` avoids `clone()` calls completely and improves memory and speed.
**Action:** Always check if a collection is needed later in the function. If not, consume it instead of borrowing it to avoid unnecessary `.clone()` calls.
